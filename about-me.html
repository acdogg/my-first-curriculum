        <p class="text">My name is Andrei and I am a Chef from the year 2013. <br>
            Before attending specialized courses, which are presented in the specific sections of this Curriculum, I practiced football for 15 years. <br>
            Then I had various jobs such as: construction site worker, street paving and asphalting worker, worker distributing advertising leaflets. <br>
            I did these activities during the college I attended, but unfortunately I didn't finish. <br>
            After these activities followed those specific to gastronomy, which, as I mentioned above, I will describe and detail in the other sections.<br>
            From 2021 I started learning programming languages such as C++, SQL but also HTML and CSS. As a result, this website where I wrote this Curriculum is made by me.
