    <h1 class="centered">Professional Experience</h1>
    <p class="centered">In this section I will present my various jobs, previous and current, where over the years, I have gained a vast experience in the field of Gastro. <br>
        Besides these, I also participated in several seminars and congresses in the field of gastronomy. <br>
        I have also read various books by famous chefs, from which I have often been inspired. Among these chefs I list Raymond Blanc, who is my role model in this field, <br>
        Tom Keridge, Massimo Bottura.<br>
        Besides the fact that I read their books, I had the opportunity to cook or eat in the restaurants of some of them.<br>
        I had the opportunity to visit and cook in Raymond Blanc's kitchen and had lunch in Tom Keridge's restaurant.
        I will now present my professional experience:
